# Deep Learning Individual Project Sample

This repository contains a sample individual project I have conducted for our deep learning class. The main goal of this project is to introduce a new topic for learning, and I have decided to choose both Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Extreme Learning Machine. These are old networks, but still hold value in business and introducing neural networks.
